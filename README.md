# Leaderboard Tutorial
In the [game dev ramp up guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/ramp-up_guides/Ramp-Up_Guide_GameTech.pdf)
there exists a "Explore additional resources" section that contains a small handful of tutorials. Once of these tutorials
is to build a leaderboard using Aurora and Elasticache.

I'm a bit lost out at sea right now in my studies. I've been engaging a lot of "skillbuilder" lessons and most recently
I've been working on the Databases for Games learning path. Now I've done something similar before -- I took the Serverless
learning path. However, I found that the lessons didn't solidify until I took the "innovator island" workshop. So I've 
learned about some database stuff, and now it is time to do this tutorial.

The tutorial is "[Build a real-time leaderboard with Amazon Aurora Serverless and Amazon
ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/tutorials/real-time-leaderboard-amazon-aurora-serverless-elasticache/)" and just like the
workshop before, I'll be trying to automate as much as possible. Largely I'll be using cloudformation and terraform to
accomplish this.

I look forward to the challenge!
